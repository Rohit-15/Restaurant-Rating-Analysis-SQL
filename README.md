# Restaurant-Rating-Analysis-SQL
This project aimed to identify trends and patterns in customer ratings, exploring the relationship between ratings, cuisines and facilities in restaurants using MySQL. The original dataset was normalized into 8 tables, covering restaurant details, customer information, and ratings.
Employing advanced querying methods such as group by clauses, data manipulation, subqueries, and window functions, the project addressed key questions to extract valuable insights from the data.The eight questions considered are as follows :-


1)Show the PlaceID along with the corresponding counts of cuisines for the top 5 places serving the highest number of cuisines.


2)Display the top 10 cuisines having the highest rating.


3)What is/are the most popular cuisines at the highest rated place?


4)What are the opening hours for the place with the most reviews?


5)Which payment methods are most commonly used at the highest-rated places for each cuisine type?


6)What is the average service rating for the top three most popular cuisines, and how many unique users have rated these cuisines?


7)What are the average ratings for places that have both parking and at least two different types of payment methods, compared to those that don't meet these criteria?


8)What are the top 3 most popular cuisines based on the average overall rating, and within those cuisines, identify the place that has the highest average food rating, along with its most preferred payment method and whether it has a parking lot?
   
These analyses provided a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing customer satisfaction and preferences in the restaurant industry.
